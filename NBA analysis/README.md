# **Analysis of PER index in modern NBA history**

The goal in this work is to analyze the PER and try to create a model that simplifies it. The general discussion of the project is outlined in the report file.

### ** Report target **
Which state has produced more NBA players? Which college is producing more NBA players? What makes a player successful? Who is the greatest player of all time (GOAT)? How 3point shooting is changing NBA? How much does a highly skilled player contribute to his team’s results? The game of basketball has changed quite a lot since the early days of the NBA, both in style as well rules and regulations. In the last decades players had to become more versatile. Big-men learned to shoot and dribble, and guards became stronger and more athletic.
In this context, the advanced statistical metric PER (Hollinger’s Player Efficiency Rating) is usually used as a predictor of inclusion on the All NBA teams (The All-NBA Team is an annual NBA honor bestowed on the best players in the league following every NBA season.). Our goal in this report is to analyze the PER and try to create a model that simplifies it, while predicting the same results. A very difficult task, since it is not so easy to determine the main variables which hold
most of the information.
